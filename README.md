# Pretrained-Object_detection
Here,simpaly used pretrained mobilenet ssd model for object detection....as we were testing which model is performing better ...<br>
This model has been pretrained with 90 class like person,mobile etc..<br>
we feed images to model ,as we also can able to feed video or webcam too...<br>
but it was just test so doesnt care much
